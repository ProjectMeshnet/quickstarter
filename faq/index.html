        <div class="question">
        	&raquo; What will come with my meshnet router?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            We will include a router flashed with OpenWRT & Cjdns with peering for Cjdns provided by Dan Ryan. 
            The router will have 5 10/100mbps ethernet ports, and be capable of 802.11n connectivity in the standard Wifi band of 2.4ghz.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
        	&raquo; Where can I see the code that this selfstarter has paid for?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            All code written to add OpenWRT support will be attached to the <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/issues/214">Cjdns OpenWRT bug</a>, 
            and if we meet our goal and move on to our stretch goal of Windows support, that code will be 
            made available <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/issues/213">here</a>. Additionally, 
            all code will be made available under the current license of cjdns.

        <div class="question">
        	&raquo; When will Cjdns work on Windows?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            If we meet the $350 goal for this Selfstarter, we will move on to our strech goal of $3250, 
            which will pay for Windows support for Cjdns.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
        	&raquo; Where is the money going?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
        	OpenWRT Support would take 10 hours at $25 USD an hour, which is $250 USB in total.
            $75 is going to be for rewards such as T-shirts and routers.
            $25 for incidental costs such as (but not limited to) payment processing fees,  
            overruns in shipping expenses, and overruns in CJD's time estimate.
			For payment processing, figure on 2.9% +30 cents. Around 4% all said and done. 
            That'd be $14 in payment processing fees in total.

        <div class="question">
        	&raquo; Who will be signing the posters?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
           	A few of the people from the Seattle Meshnet. Most likely it'll be Finn Hertzfeld, Dan Ryan, and Matthew Bentley.
